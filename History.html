        <p>The history of New York unfolded over several centuries and the occupation of the territory by Amerindian
            populations began, long before the arrival of the first settlers in what is now Manhattan. The negotiations
            that led to the current configuration of New York with a division into five boroughs: Manhattan, Queens,
            Brooklyn, the Bronx and Staten Island, only date back to the nineteenth century and the first half of the
            twentieth century. Before this «consolidation», n. 1 The city was the theater of various conflicts, with a
            high crime rate. Despite this, it managed to gain progressively greater importance, to the point of
            constituting today the largest city in the United States and one of the most important and dynamic
            metropolises in the world, not only in demographic terms,1 but also as a center of top decision maker and
            the world capital of finance and the stock market.</p>

        <p>The first European contacts with New York were made through Giovanni da Verrazano, who on April 17, 1524,
            anchored near New York Bay, before continuing his route north. Later, on September 2, 1609, Henry Hudson
            entered the bay formed by the "Great Mountain River." Years later, the Dutch conquered the bay and founded
            the New Netherlands, when Adriaen Block settled for a few months on the island of Manhattan in 1613. In
            1625, other families were sent to Manhattan in various ships and formed a colony in New York, achieving that
            the colony of New Amsterdam officially emerged in 1626 with the purchase by Pierre Minuit. Between the 17th
            and 18th centuries, the maritime rivalry between the Dutch and the English came to an end with the victory
            of the latter in North America. The King of England Charles II donated to his brother, the Duke of York,
            this land was immediately renamed "New York" in honor of the Duke of York. In 1785, the Continental Congress
            moved to New York, which has since served as the provisional capital of the United States.</p>
